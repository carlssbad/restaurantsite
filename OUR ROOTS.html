          <h1> Roots of Flavor </h1>
<p> This savory joint began with the Chef Izzy's love for spices and flavor. She wanting to utilize the explosions of flavor to help her joint grow and have a better experience for the customers visiting. This restaurant only serves dinner for the evenings to create a relaxing time through the day as people can get their minds off everything else. It resides on the coast of Venice Beach off a long driveway. The deluctable dishes create savory moments and push people to feel like they are in a different element. </p>
